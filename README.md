## 🚀 Featured Project

### TextBasedUNO-Cpp
> A console-based UNO card game implemented in C++.

- **Short Description:**  
  A fully text-based simulation of the popular UNO card game. Supports drawing cards, turn-based gameplay, and special action cards such as Reverse, Skip, Draw Two, and Wild. Players can be human or simple AI.
- **Key Technologies & Concepts:**  
  - **Language:** C++ (C++11 and above)  
  - **STL Usage:** `std::vector` for hand management, `std::shuffle` for shuffling the deck  
  - **Object-Oriented Design:**  
    - `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game` classes to encapsulate game logic  
    - Simple inheritance for different card types (number, color, special)  
  - **Console I/O:** `std::cin` / `std::cout` for user interaction in the terminal  
  - **Game Flow Control:** Loops and conditional statements to handle turns and determine the winner  
- **Repository:** [TextBasedUNO-Cpp](https://github.com/Hamidreza-ahd/TextBasedUNO-Cpp)
